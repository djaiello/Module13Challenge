        <h3>Project Description:</h5>
        <p class="descrip">Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. One of our goals is to discover and document these bacteria. For this project, we are interested in bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. This lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup, to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on a person's eyelashes, for example. Furthermore, between individuals, the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. We have hypothesized that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button. We are sampling the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person has been assigned an ID number for the project. This dashboard provides research participants and researchers with the ability to see which bacterial species live in test subject’s navels as well as some basic demographic information on each participant.  With this information we hope to find a species that synthesizes the perfect “synthetic beef” proteins…</p><br><br>
